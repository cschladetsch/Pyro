# Test Exectutor

Tests the functionalilty of the `Executor` system, which is in turn based on `Continuation` and `Tree`.

The Executor only interprets and runs Pi Code. Pi is either generated manually, which can be confusing because it uses
Reverse Polish Notation, or by using `Rho` which smells a lot more like Python but yet produces Pi code that is
exectuted in the same manner as native `Pi` code.
