# Core Library
Contains the core types.
You can think of this as being equivalent to the `System` dll for .Net. 

## Registry

This is a C# code for a class called "Registry" that serves as a store of instances and a mapping of types to factories. 

The class contains several dictionaries that store the registered classes, instances, and class names. 

It provides methods to add, register, and retrieve instances and classes, as well as create new instances of registered classes. 

The class also has methods to convert instances to *Pi* script, duplicate instances, and handle exceptions related to creating classes. Overall, the Registry class provides a centralized location for managing and accessing instances and classes within a system.
