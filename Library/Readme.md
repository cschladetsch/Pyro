# Libraries

Each library has its own `Readme.md`.

Libraries and Executables are built to [/Bin](Bin).

To be able to debug into the libraries from *Unity3d* app, run `conv.bat` from within the `Bin` folder. This converts the `.pdb` files generated by *Visual Studio* to `.mdp` files used by *Mono*.
