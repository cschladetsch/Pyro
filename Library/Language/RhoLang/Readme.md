# Rho Language

This is a Python-like, more human-readable language to be used across the wire.

*Rho* translates to *Pi* and uses the exact same [Executor](/Language/Core/Executor).

## Coroutines

Has built-in support for Continuations, including the following three main operations:

* `Suspend`. This is similar to a traditional function call. Execution will return to current context after being suspended to the given coroutine.
* `Replace`. This will continue what is on the data stack, and will not return to current context.
* `Resume`. This drops the current context completely, and resumes whatever is on the data stack.

## Embedded Pi

*Rho* code can have *Pi* code embedded in it, contained between back-tic ` characters:
```
assert(`1 1 +` == 2)
```
